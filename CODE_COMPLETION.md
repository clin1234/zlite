# Code completion.

[Clangd](https://clangd.llvm.org) provides code completion and suggestions to any editor or IDE
that supports it. This file contains flags passed to `clang`, one per line. Feel free to 
modify them.

Alternatively, a `.ccls` file is available for those using `ccls`. Both files have been tested
only with Clang.

List of editors is (here)[https://langserver.org].
